TO RUN SERVER:
1. FIRST OPEN ANY TERMINAL
2. run  `cd NodeJSApi`          make sure before running the server, we are in the NodeJsApi directory.
3. run `node server.js`      When we node the server, we should be able to see a prompt saying the server and the database are successfully initialized.
4. run the front end repository by running `npm install` and `npm start`


Additional instructions to run the front end can be found in the Front End repository readme markdown documentation.
